# Problem 1 (Measures of Central Tendency)
  # A fruit vendor recorded the number of mangoes sold each day for 12 days: [12, 15, 14, 10, 18, 20, 22, 22, 19, 17, 16, 18]

# Find the median.
median(mangoes_sold)

# Find the mode.
x <- table(mangoes_sold)

# Problem 2 (Measure of Spread)
  # A factory measured the daily production (in tons) over 7 days: [120, 135, 128, 140, 150, 138, 132]

# Find the standard deviation.
sd(daily_production)


# Problem 3 (Percentiles & Quartiles)
  # A group of students received the following exam scores: [45, 50, 55, 60, 62, 65, 70, 72, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95]

# Problem 4 (Column Min, Max, Range)
  # A farmer measured the heights (cm) of two plant types across 5 samples:
    # Plant A: [120, 135, 128, 140, 125]

# Problem 5 (Skewness, Kurtosis & Histogram)
  # A researcher recorded the reaction times (in seconds) of 12 participants in a psychology experiment:
    # [2.1, 2.5, 1.8, 2.3, 2.7, 3.0, 2.2, 1.9, 2.6, 2.8, 2.4, 3.1]

# Interpret whether the distribution is skewed left/right and whether it is leptokurtic, mesokurtic, or platykurtic.

# Problem 6 (Summary & Describe)
  # A professor recorded the final project scores of 9 students: [72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 93]

final_project_scores <- c(72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 93)
