# Lesson 2 Topics:

1. Importing CSV: importing a .csv file inside RStudio.
2. Head: display the first 6 rows of the dataset. 
3. Tail: display the last 6 rows of the dataset.
4. Class: checks what is the type of the variable.
5. Type of: checks the R internal type or storage mode of any object.
6. Number of Rows: total rows in a dataset.
7. Number of Columns: total columns in a dataset.
8. Number of Characters: total characters in a word.
9. String Concatenation: a process of combining two or more strings into a single larger string.
10. Subset: selecting specific portions of data from a larger data structure.
11. Subsetting: the process of selecting specific portions of data from a larger data structure.
12. Paste: concatenates elements into character strings.
13. Any: determines if at least one value in a set of logical vectors is TRUE.
14. If Else: conditional statements used to control the flow of execution based on whether a specified condition is TRUE or FALSE.
15. Data Frame: a data structure used to store and organize data in a tabular format.
16. Adding a row: adds a row.
17. Adding a column: adds a column.
18. Dplyr: is an R package that provides a consistent and powerful set of tools for data manipulation, particularly with data frames.
  18.1 Filter: is used to select a subset of rows from a data frame based on specified conditions.
  18.2 Mutate: is used to create new variables (columns) or modify existing ones within a data frame.
19. Order: is used to obtain a permutation of indices that would sort a vector, data frame, or matrix.
20. Sum: It can be applied to numeric, complex, or logical vectors.
21. N/A: missing value.
22. Omit: removing elements.
23. View: view the contents of data structures interactively in a spreadsheet-like format.
24. Length: determine the number of elements within an object.
25. Attributes: pieces of information or metadata stored alongside an object.
26. Names: to get or set the names of elements within an object.
27. Structure: These are the fundamental ways data is organized and stored in R.
28. Data Structure: a specific way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory so that it can be efficiently accessed, manipulated, and processed.
29. Sequence: an ordered set of elements
30. Matrix: is a fundamental data structure representing a two-dimensional, rectangular collection of elements of the same data type.
31. Remove: removing an object from the environment.

# Functions Used:

- **head()** = for seeing the first 6 rows.
- **tail()** = for seeing the last 6 rows.
- **library()** = for loading installed packages in R.
- **filter()** = finds rows/columns where conditions are true.
- **subset()** = for creating subsets (selecting specific rows/columns).
- **order()** = sorts a vector, data frame, or a list.
- **is.na()** = checks if there are NAs.
- **na.omit()** = Removes NAs.
- **View()** = for viewing the imported .csv.
- **any()** = checks if there are any elements that possess the conditions stated.
- **mutate()** = a dplyr package function used for data manipulation.
- **class()** = checks what is the type of the variable.
- **typeof()** = returns "double" or "character" or "logical" or "integer" or "complex" or "lists".
- **sum()** = checks the sum.
