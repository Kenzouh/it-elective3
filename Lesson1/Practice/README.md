# Lesson 1 Topics:

1. Vector creation: vector is a dynamic arrayâ€”a data structure that stores a sequence of elements of the same data type.
2. Data Structure: is a specialized format for organizing, storing, and managing data in a computer's memory or storage.
3. Names: setting the name of an object.
4. Sequence: a particular order in which related events, movements, or things follow each other.
5. Concatenation: a process of combining two or more strings into a single larger string.
6. Repetition: repeating elements.
7. List: listing elements.
8. Length: calculates the length of an object.
9. Matrix: A matrix is a two dimensional data set with columns and rows. A column is a vertical representation of data, while a row is a horizontal representation of data.
10. Row Bind: joining of multiple rows.
11. Column Bind: joining of multiple columns.
12. Data Frame: a two-dimensional table of data with rows and columns.
13. Removing Objects: removing objects in RStudio.
14. Data Extraction: is the process of collecting or retrieving relevant data from various sources, such as databases, websites, documents, and applications, for further analysis, processing, or storage.
15. Subsetting: is the process of selecting and isolating a part, or subset, of a larger collection of data or elements for a specific purpose.
16. Array: An array is a collection of values.
