This repository includes 4 lessons about my R Programming Language Summer Class.

# Lesson 1

Lesson 1 is about the introduction of R Programming Language. In this lesson, we created vectors, understanding data structure, creating sequences, concatenating strings, creating lists, matrices, data frames, subsetting and creating arrays.

## Functions Used:

c()
cat()
is.vector()
names()
str()
sequence()
seq()
rep()
list()
length()
is.list()
matrix()
rbind()
cbind()
data.frame()
rm()
array()

## Operator Used:
Colon Operator (:)

# Lesson 2

Lesson 2 is about importing a .csv file, understanding the dataset, and data manipulation. In here, we get the sum, display specific values, subsetted, and omit NAs.

## Functions Used:

head()
tail()
library()
filter()
subset()
order()
is.na()
na.omit()
View()
any()
mutate()
class()
typeof()
sum()

# Lesson 3

Lesson 3 is about cleaning messy data with column extraction, global regular expression, column concatenation and getting the sum.

## Functions Used:

data.frame()
substr()
list()
unlist()
gregexpr()
sub()
gsub()
match()
month.abb: not really a function.
as.numeric()

# Lesson 4

Lesson 4 is about Descriptive Statistics, specifically finding the Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Spread, Percentiles & Quartiles, Matrix Stats, Skewness and Creating Plots.
