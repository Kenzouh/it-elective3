This repository includes 4 lessons about my R Programming Language Summer Class.

# Lesson 1

Lesson 1 is about the introduction of R Programming Language. In this lesson, we created vectors, understanding data structure, creating sequences, concatenating strings, creating lists, matrices, data frames, subsetting and creating arrays.

# Lesson 2

Lesson 2 is about importing a .csv file, understanding the dataset, and data manipulation. In here, we get the sum, display specific values, subsetted, and omit NAs.

# Lesson 3

Lesson 3 is about cleaning messy data with column extraction, global regular expression, column concatenation and getting the sum.

# Lesson 4

Lesson 4 is about Descriptive Statistics, specifically finding the Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Spread, Percentiles & Quartiles, Matrix Stats, Skewness and Creating Plots.
